### Welcome to Storm Database Explorer

The data for this application comes from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. The data was recorded from 1993 to 2011. 

The Dataset has been obtained from [the Coursera site](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2)

The dataset has been processed and cleaned up. The tidy dataset as well as the the source code (server.R and ui.R) are available on [GitHub](http://github.com/me2181904/Developing_Data_Products_Using_Shiny): https://github.com/me2181904/Developing_Data_Products_Using_Shiny

You can adjust the date range and event types using the slider and the check boxes located on the left side of the plot tab. 

Use the slider to specify the date range. The range can start anywhere after 1993 and end anywhere before 2011.

Select all or any combination of event types. 

Use the "Population Impact" and "Economic Impact" filters to narrow down the scope of the data. 

The results are plotted "By state" and "By year" and can be viewed when you select the appropriate tab. Scroll down to view all the plotted results. 

The Filtered dataset can be downloaded in CVS format from the Data tab.
